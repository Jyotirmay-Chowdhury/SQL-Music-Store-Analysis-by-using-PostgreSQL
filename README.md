# SQL-Music-Store-Analysis-by-using-PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL project to analyze online music store data  This project is for beginners and will teach you how to analyze the music playlist database. 

The project might involve creating a database schema to store information about the music store's products, customers, sales transactions, and other relevant data. Once the database schema is set up, the project may involve loading the data into the database, performing data cleaning and transformation, and then using SQL queries to analyze the data.
